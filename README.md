### This theme was made with the intention to provide a cohesive dark environment for coding
**Rules that I followed:**
* No borders;
* One main color `#252422` for the UI, used everywhere it was possible without making it confusing;
* The darkest color `#1f1f1e` only appears in thin accents;
* One main orange color `#ba5624` to highlight actions that change what you are doing (coding to debugging to opening a menu);
* One off-white color `#b7b3a1` for displaying text throughout the theme;
* Consistent colors for similar things;
